    "# Introduction to the Planner\n",
    "\n",
    "The Planner is one of the fundamental concepts of the Semantic Kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "It makes use of the collection of native and semantic functions that have been registered to the kernel and using AI, will formulate a plan to execute the given ask.\n",
    "\n",
    "From our own testing, planner works best with more powerful models like `gpt4` but sometimes you might get working plans with cheaper models like `gpt-35-turbo`.\n",
